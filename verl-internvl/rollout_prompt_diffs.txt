 Hint: The inscribed angle theorem states that an inscribed angle is half of the central angle that intercepts the same arc. Since angle AOC (central angle) = 80° and angle ABC (inscribed angle) both intercept arc AC, angle ABC = 80° ÷ 2 = 40°.
 Simply indicate the correct answer by typing the letter from the given options.
 In the given diagram, AB represents the diameter of circle O, and BC stands for the chord of circle O. If angle AOC measures 80.0 degrees, what is the measure of angle ABC? Express the measure of angle ABC as θ.

 Hint: This is a right triangle with a 60° angle. The side labeled 8 is adjacent to the 60° angle, and y is the hypotenuse. Use cos(60°) = 8/y to solve for y.
 Find y.

 Hint: The triangle has two sides of equal length (8 in. each) and the angle between them is 60°. This makes it an isosceles triangle with a 60° vertex angle, which means all angles are 60° and it is actually equilateral.
 Find Y Z.
